Services
===========

This section describes :term:`Service` and underlying :term:`Resource` elements packaged with `Magpie`, as well as
their respective functionalities and intended procedural behavior.

Basic Service and Resource details
------------------------------------

Each :term:`Service` is a specialization of a :term:`Resource` (see: :class:`magpie.models.Service` implementation).
Therefore, they can be listed and searched for either using ``/services`` API routes (using ``service_name``) or using
``/resources`` API routes (with their attributed ``resource_id``), whichever is more convenient for the required needs.

On top of any :term:`Resource`'s metadata, a :term:`Service` provide specific information about its location, its
remote synchronization method (if any), any its exposed endpoint. Another important detail about the :term:`Service`
is its type. This will not only dictate its purpose, but also define the whole schema of allowed :term:`Resource` under
it (if any), as well as every one of their :ref:`Allowed Permissions`.

The final distinction between a :term:`Service` and generic :term:`Resource` is their position in the hierarchy. Only
:term:`Service`-specialized :term:`Resource` (literally ``resource_type = "service"``) are allowed to be placed at the
top of the tree hierarchy. All generic :term:`Resource` nodes must be nested under some root :term:`Service`. Relative
references are indicated using ``parent_id`` and ``root_service_id`` in corresponding :term:`Resource` details.

.. todo: even if not implementing above, could be good to document fields or ServiceInterface for future reference

Service Synchronization
------------------------

.. todo:
    resource auto-sync feature for a given service and cron configuration setup for it

.. seealso::

    Utility ``magpie_sync_resources`` in `Magpie CLI Helpers`_ is also available to manually launch a :term:`Resource`
    synchronization operation for supporting :term:`Service`-types.
